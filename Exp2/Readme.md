## Experiment no- 02 Creating Branches with GitHub.
**1. Aim/Overview of the practical:** Creating Branches with GitHub.  
**2. Task to be done:** Creation of branches, Merging of branches and Deletion of branches.  
**3. Steps for Experiment: -**  
1) On GitHub.com, go to your account navigate to the main page of the repository i.e.(22BCD-1).  
2) From your repository click on the file tree view on the left, select the branch dropdown menu, then click on Main.  
3) Apart from this, by clicking on View All Branches you can see all the branches created.  
4) So, by default you will be in Main branch (default branch).  
5) Now, click on Add File... Select "Create new file" option.

6) After clicking on “Create new file” Enter your file name i.e. (Add.c).

7) The (Add.c) file is created in the “Main branch”, now write a simple code for adding two numbers in your file.

8) So, now we have to create another branch from “Main branch” i.e. (Feature_Branch).    
9) In the "Find or create a branch..." text field, type a unique name for your new branch, then click Create branch i.e.(test_Branch).

10) After Creating a Feature branch from the “Main branch”, now in the Feature branch we have to do some changes in the (Add.c) file which was created in the main branch.

11) In the Main Branch file the variables are (num1, num2,sum) and now in feature branch after some changes the variables are (num,num2,sum).    
12) Now go to “Main branch” a compare and pull request notification is reflected.         
13) Now click on the Compare & Pull request.    
14) After clicking on Compare and Pull Request, it will be visible what changes have been made in the feature branch.

15) 1Now compare the changes in the file, after comparison it will show whether the file is able to be merged or there are some conflicts.

16) Now click on create pull request after that the files will be merge if there was no conflict occur in the branches. The Branch is successfully Merged without any conflicts.  
### Creating a Branch on Bash/GUI: -  
• To Change the directory a branch: touch <File1>

• To Create a file: touch <File1>

• After creating a file in the “Main Branch” check for “git status” and add the file in “git add File1”.      
![Screenshot 2024-03-02 164740](https://github.com/adarshkrsingh07/Pract_Sem04/assets/123314058/b52e1146-926f-4a23-82b5-8b6f68b4885c)    
• After Creating a file now enter your message: vi File1, after that check “git status” it will show that the File1 is modified.

• Now create a Feature_branch from the main branch i.e.(testBranch).  
![Screenshot 2024-03-02 164755](https://github.com/adarshkrsingh07/Pract_Sem04/assets/123314058/910b114d-d180-48eb-9692-ad2e95eeeab1)  
• Now open the same file by vi File1.txt in the “testBranch” and perform some changes on it.

• Now Commit the changes in main branch of file i.e.(testFile).
![Screenshot 2024-03-02 164808](https://github.com/adarshkrsingh07/Pract_Sem04/assets/123314058/803b7302-6dfd-4868-abd6-5a425add5620)  
• After creating a file in the “Main branch” and also commiting it. after, that we have to merge the (testfile) of “feature_branch” in the Main branch.  
![Screenshot 2024-03-02 164815](https://github.com/adarshkrsingh07/Pract_Sem04/assets/123314058/4fc569c2-1bfe-4c41-81a1-5c8397c38043)    
• After merging the branches now we have to delete the branches: “git branch –-delete “branch_name”    
![Screenshot 2024-03-02 164822](https://github.com/adarshkrsingh07/Pract_Sem04/assets/123314058/3a12fca4-1d19-49b3-bae7-4c3aa78fc282)  
We have successfully created a file and merged in the Main Branch.

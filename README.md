# Practicals  
This repository contains all the practicals performed in semester 4:   

  1. ## Git and GitHub practicals
     Branch:(https://github.com/Jatin048/Practicals/tree/Git-and-Hub)
     
     * Exp 1.1 Installation of Git and creating repository
       Install git on local machine (Installation guide including all steps to install as well as configure) as well as configuring github account;Creating a new repository on github remote repository;

       Exp: (https://github.com/Jatin048/Practicals/blob/Git-and-Hub/Exp1/Jatin.docx)
     * Exp 1.2 Creating branches with GitHub
       Explore branches on remote repository using github;How to create branches from naming to adding files in new branch;
       Folder: (https://github.com/Jatin048/Practicals/tree/Git-and-Hub/Exp2)
       Exp: (https://github.com/Jatin048/Practicals/blob/Git-and-Hub/Exp2/Jatin_2.docx)
     * Exp 1.3 To create and explore Pull request
       Explore about pull request in git and link your local repository to remote repository using git clone which creates a local copy of the remote repository;
       Folder: (https://github.com/Jatin048/Practicals/tree/Git-and-Hub/Exp3)
       Exp: (https://github.com/Jatin048/Practicals/blob/Git-and-Hub/Exp3/Jatin_3.docx)
     * Exp 2.1 Editing a file and committing changes on GitHub
       Using git pull and git push we first get the contents of remote repositor on local machine; Then we do necessary changes such as adding a file or changing contents of file ; Using git push we push the changes back to the remote repository after committing the changes;
       Folder: (https://github.com/Jatin048/Practicals/tree/Git-and-Hub/Exp4)
       Exp: (https://github.com/Jatin048/Practicals/blob/Git-and-Hub/Exp4/Jatin_4.docx)
     * Exp 2.2 To merge Pull request and update  local repository
       To explore about pull in git as well as merge confict in case of using pull on 2 different remote repository on same local repository with different commit history; we have to use different command to aloow pull with unrelated histories as demonstrated;

       Exp: (https://github.com/Jatin048/Practicals/blob/Git-and-Hub/Exp5/Jatin_5.docx)

     * Exp 2.3 Creation of forks
       In this we fork a repository (remote) and make a clone of it on our local system then we edit a file in it and push back the changes from local to remote forked repository.

       Exp : (https://github.com/Jatin048/Practicals/blob/Git-and-Hub/Exp6/Jatin_6.docx)
      

  2. ## Data analysis and algorithm
     Branch:(https://github.com/Jatin048/Practicals/tree/Data-analysis-and-algorithm)
     * Exp 1.1 Implementation of Binary Search using the Divide & Conquer Approach.
       In this algorithm,we want to find whether element x belongs to a set of numbers stored in an array of numbers[]. Where l and r represent the left and right index of a sub-array in which the searchingoperationshould be performed.
       Folder : (https://github.com/Jatin048/Practicals/tree/Data-analysis-and-algorithm/Exp1)
       Exp : (https://github.com/Jatin048/Practicals/blob/Data-analysis-and-algorithm/Exp1/binarySearch_Exp1.c)
     * Exp 1.2 Implementation of Quick Sort using Divide & Conquer Approach.
       Sort a given set of elements using the Quick sort method and determine the time required to sort the elements. Repeat the experiment for different values of n, the number of elements in the list to be sorted and plot a graph of the time taken versus n. The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using the random number generator.

       Exp : (https://github.com/Jatin048/Practicals/blob/Data-analysis-and-algorithm/Exp2/quickSort_Exp2.c)
     * Exp 1.3 Implement Strassen Matrix Multiplication using Divide & Conquer Approach.
       The aim is to design a program, which generates two matrices with various dimensions and multiplies the two matrices usingstrassen's algorithm. In linear algebra, the Strassen algorithm, named after Volker Strassen, is an algorithm for matrix multiplication. It is faster than the standard matrix multiplication algorithm for large matrices, with a better asymptotic complexity.

       Exp : (https://github.com/Jatin048/Practicals/blob/Data-analysis-and-algorithm/Exp3/strassenMatrix_Exp3.c)
     * Exp 2.1 Find out the Minimum Cost Spanning Tree using Kruskal’s Algorithm with the help of the Greedy Approach.
       Kruskal's algorithm: Kruskal’s algorithm finds the minimum spanning tree for a weighted connected graph G=(V,E) to get an acyclic sub graph with |V|-1 edges for which the sum of edge weights is the smallest.

       Exp : (https://github.com/Jatin048/Practicals/blob/Data-analysis-and-algorithm/Exp4/kruskalAlgorithm_Exp4.c)
     * Exp 2.2 Perform Job Sequencing with a deadline using the Greedy Approach using C/C++.
       In the job sequencing problem, the objective is to find a sequence of jobs, which is completed within their deadlines and gives maximum profit.
